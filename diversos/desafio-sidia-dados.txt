Um dos que eu fiz na ultima entrevista foi o forgottenResults:
You have just rolled a dice several times. The N roll results that you remember are described by an array A. However, there are F rolls whose results you have forgotten. The arithmetic mean of all the roll results(the sum of all the roll results divided by the number of rolls) equals M.
Return one of the possible results of the missing rolls? 
Return [0] if possible rolls doesn't exist!
